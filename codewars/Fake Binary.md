#### Description:

Given a string of numbers, you should replace any number below 5 with '0' and any number 5 and above with '1'. Return the resulting string.


#### Solution:

```Haskell
module Codewars.Kata.FakeBinary where

fakeBin :: String -> String
fakeBin [] = []
fakeBin (x:xs) = c:fakeBin xs
  where c = if x >= '5' then '1' else '0'
```
